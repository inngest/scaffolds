# Python 3.10 Scaffold

This scaffold creates a base function for running serverless functions with Python 3.10
using the slim "buster" Debian base image. It contains the following functionality:

- Python 3.10
- Pip 3
- Automatic type generation for your events
- A Dockerfile for packaging and publishing your function

## Getting started

You can use this scaffold directly with the [Inngest CLI](https://github.com/inngest/inngest-cli):

```
inngest init
```

Choose the "Python" language, and then select the "Python 3.10".
