# Node.js 16 LTS Scaffold

This scaffold creates a minimal base function for running serverless functions with
Node 16. It contains the following functionality:

- Node 16 LTS
- Automatic type generation for your events
- A Dockerfile for packaging and publishing your function

## Getting started

You can use this scaffold directly with the [Inngest CLI](https://github.com/inngest/inngestctl):

```
inngestctl init
```

Choose the "JavaScript" language, and then select the "Node 16 LTS".
