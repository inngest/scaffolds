# Typescript 4.5 & Node 16 LTS Scaffold

This scaffold creates a base function for running serverless functions with
Typescript and Node 16. It contains the following functionality:

- TypeScript 4.5
- Node 16 LTS
- Jest for Testing
- Automatic type generation for your events
- A Dockerfile for packaging and publishing your function

## Getting started

You can use this scaffold directly with the [Inngest CLI](https://github.com/inngest/inngest-cli):

```
inngest init
```

Choose the "Typescript" language, and then select the "TS 4.5 & Node 16 LTS".
